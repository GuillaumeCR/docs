        <p>
          The Polymer Project team builds a variety of libraries and tools for developers. The following major products are under active
          development::
        </p>
        <ul>

          <li>
            <strong>
              <a href="https://github.com/Polymer/lit-element">LitElement</a>
            </strong>. An ultra-light, highly performant custom element base class with a simple but expressive API.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>

          <li>
            <strong>
              <a href="https://github.com/Polymer/pwa-starter-kit/wiki">PWA Starter Kit</a>
            </strong>. A set of starting templates for building full-featured Progressive Web Apps using web components and optionally
            Redux for state management.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>

          <li>
            <strong>
              <a href="https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web-components">Material Web Components</a>
            </strong>. High-fidelity versions of Google's Material Design spec that work anywhere on the web.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>

          <li>
            <strong>
              <a href="https://www.polymer-project.org/3.0/docs/tools/overview">Polymer CLI and related tools</a>
            </strong>. Development tools that help with scaffolding out projects, serving, testing, and building projects for production.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>

          <li>
            <strong>
              <a href="https://github.com/Polymer/lit-html">lit-html library</a>
            </strong>. A small, lightweight templating library, used by LitElement.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The Polymer Project also maintains the following products:
        </p>
        <ul>

          <li>
            <strong>
              <a href="https://www.polymer-project.org/3.0/docs/devguide/feature-overview">Polymer Classic library 3.x</a>
            </strong>. Our original web components library (also known as the Polymer library or simply "Polymer"). Version 3.x is
            updated to use JavaScript modules and npm, for seamless interop with popular frameworks and tools.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>

          <li>
            <strong>Polymer Classic library
              <a href="https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/docs/devguide/feature-overview">1.x</a> and
              <a href="https://www.polymer-project.org/2.0/docs/devguide/feature-overview">2.x</a>
            </strong>. Previous versions of the library. Versions 1.x and 2.x use HTML imports (a proposed web standard which is no
            longer on track to be standardized), and are distributed using Bower. Version 1.x also uses an older set of web
            components standards. </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>

          <li>
            <strong>Polymer element collections</strong> (paper-, iron- and gold- elements). Two major versions of the elements are
            currently supported: a version compatible with Polymer classic library 3.x, and a
            <em>hybrid</em> version that works with version 1.x and 2.x of the library.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          These projects are in maintenance mode: we're fixing bugs, but we're not doing new feature work on them. For more information
          on our product lifecycle, see How we support our products.
        </p>
        <h2>But what should I use?</h2>


        <p>
          That's a lot of products to think about! How do you know what to use? He's a quick summary of what we recommend for some
          common use cases.

            <td>Developing a new element from scratch.
            </td>
            <td>
              <strong>LitElement</strong>. It provides a simple, performant, and lightweight base class.
            </td>
          </tr>

            <td>Developing a new app from scratch.
            </td>
            <td>
              <strong>PWA Starter Kit</strong>. It provides a number of templates for starting a modern Progressive Web App using
              web components.
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Updating an app written using Polymer 1.x or 2.x elements.
            </td>
            <td>
              <strong>Polymer 3.x</strong>. Moving to Polymer 3 removes the need for the HTML imports polyfill. It also makes it
              easier to work with existing ES modules distributed using npm; and to use third-party tools.
              <br>
              <br> An app built using Polymer 3 elements can more easily take advantage of new elements distributed as ES modules,
              including the Material Web Components.
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Maintaining an app written using Polymer 1.x or 2.x elements, with no feature work planned.
            </td>
            <td>
              <strong>Polymer 2.x</strong>. If you don't plan any new feature work on your app, you probably don't need to migrate
              to Polymer 3.x.
              <br>
              <br> If you're still on Polymer 1.x, we recommend upgrading to 2.x to take advantage of the native web components
              v1 support that's shipping in Chrome and Safari (and in progress on other browsers). Polymer 1.x relies on
              older web components standards that are only implemented in Chrome.

              <strong>Material Web Components</strong>. These elements are more performant than the earlier paper elements, and follow
              the latest version of the web components spec.

              <strong>Paper elements or third-party component</strong>. Almost all of the paper elements are available in 3.x-compatible
              versions.

                  === Should we add a paragraph here about the drawbacks of these elements (i.e., pulling in all of Polymer to PWA-starter-kit)?
                  Would be really great if we could link to a spreadsheet or something that showed people what to expect:
                  i.e., app-layout elements: use for now, ultimately replace with a new version based on LitElement. platinum-sw;
                  use Workbox (or whatever it 's called now) directly. Paper-button, use this equivalent in MWC. foo-bar,
                  use paper version until a MWC version is available. Bar-baz, will not have a MWC replacement, look for
                  a third-party replacement.===</em>
